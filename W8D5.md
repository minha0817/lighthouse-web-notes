## Version Managers
- It's useful tools to allow us to easily download and switch between different versions of software like node.

## What is Node?

- Node is a Javascript Runtime.
- We execute Node to run JS.
- Updating Node on their machine could break older projects. That's why we need Version Control.

## What is NVM?

- NVM is the Node Version Manager.
- Allows a developer to use their command line to switch between different versions of node on their machine.
```js
nvm install 8.0.0
nvm use 8.0.0
nvm ls / nvm list
nvm alias default v9.3.0
```

### yield

- 마치 자바스크립트의 callback function처럼 ruby는 yield나 &blk 을 이용해서 block을 parameter처럼 사용할수가 있다.  이 block은 주로 do end 모양.
