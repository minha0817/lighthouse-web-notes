### Automated Testing

- why do we write tests? Enhanced workflows & confidence

- Write tests: Certain types of testing should be automated.

- Not too many: We don't need 100% code coverage to have a high level of confidence.

- Mostly integration: These types of tests are more thorough and test how the different parts of the application work together.

### four distinct categories of tests
1. static - linting and static typing
2. unit - to test components in isolation. - storybook, jest
3. integration - to test the logic at the intersection of multiple components.
4. end-to-end -  End-to-end tests to simulate user interaction and provide the most confidence. We will use this to replace the manual process used to test common user flows.
 - E2E tests - cypress

### Test Driven Development

* Red - Write a small test that doesn't pass.
* Green - Do the minimal amount of work to make the test pass.
* Refactor - Improve the code, continuing to ensure all tests still pass.


Writing tests should save us time in the long run, and test consistency gives us a higher degree of confidence.
