### Component creation steps
- To build our new components, we should follow the same steps as before.

1. Create a file with our component name
2. Create & Export the component function
3. Add the base HTML in the return statement of our component
4. Create & Import a CSS / SCSS file holding the style of our component
5. Write stories for Storybook to render our component in isolation
6. Refactor the hardcoded content to use props & state


### prop drilling (threading)

- List passes a setItem function down to the ListItem


### Storybook Syntax

- An argument can be passed to a function in Storybook by wrapping it in () after the name of the action, as seen in the code above.

- The purpose of this is to try and reduce the amount of duplicated state within the application.

```jsx
setInterviewer={() => action("setInterviewer")(interviewer.id)}
```


###  value and onChange prop

- allow a developer to quickly understand this

```jsx
before : 
    <DayList
            days={days}
            day={day}
            setDay={setDay}
          />
after : 
          <DayList
            days={days}
            value={day}
            onChange={setDay}
          />

```


### Storybook
-  ***action()*** allows us to create a callback that appears in the Storybook actions panel when the event happens.

- In Storybook, we specify the name of the prop and then call action(), which takes a string argument. 

- The string that is passed to action() will be displayed in the Storybook Actions panel when the component is clicked.

***Appointment***

1. when it's empty (<Empty>)
2. when it's booked (<Show>)
3. when we want a user to confirm an action (<Confirm>)
4. when it's loading (<Status>)
5. when there is an error (<Error>)
6. Default (<index.js>)



- Make sure to create proper props for child component whenever we make parents components.
