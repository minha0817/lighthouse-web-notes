# W03D05 - Data structure, Trees

# Data structure
- Arrays and objects are the group of primitive data and there are other data structures other than objects and arrays. That is `tree`.
- Data structures allow us to organize our data and we can build tree for that.
- Trees are powerful data structure of hierarchical structure.
- Each circle in the tree is called a node
- `Node` represents a key entity and contains data.
- All the connections between the nodes are called `Edges`.

# Traversing
- Similar like looping through an array. It's how we can visit every node.
- Breadth first traversal (BFS) : check the closest node to the root node
- Depth first traversal (DFS) : It treats every node as the root node of a slightly smaller tree. 11223
