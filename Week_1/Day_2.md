### Summary of Day 2
&nbsp;
#### 
* `Git`
* each folder should have only one git repository
* what's git?<br> Back up copy on Github, keeps a history of the code by commiting and help work better as a team.<br>
* `git commands?` <br> `git add . / git log / git status / git remote -v and etc / git reset --hard <gitaddress>` (Delete updated git) <br>
&nbsp;

*  `How to approach problem solving?`
1. state the hypothesis
2. verify the hypothesis
3. make changes <br>

*divide problems into step by step -> regular case and edge case, work on regular case first -> console.log as many as possible to check the process. (`console.log("Args:, arg`))<br>

&nbsp;

* `return vs process.exit()`

* `function` <br>
1. Benefits of functon : reusable, has name which gives us clear idea of what it does.
2. how to name of function : follow the conventions.
3. function should focus on a single task.
4. Data should be passed into as parameter/arguments(local scope)
5. 2 types of function : function expression & function declaration 

* `global scope vs local scope` <br>
global scope is avaiable anywhere whereas local scope is avaiable only where it's defined.

* `stack trace`

* `type coercion` <br>
자료형을 다른형태로 해주는것. 마치 숫자0이 상황에 따라 falshy값이 되는것처럼 

* `truthy value vs falshy value` <br>
most of them are truthy except `0, false, "", null, undefined, NaN`. <br>
when do we use? truthy values are a fast and easy way to check conditions in our code.
