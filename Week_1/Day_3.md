#### `Data types` <br>
1. Primitive data types : Essential building blocks. `undefined, Boolean, null, NaN, string, number, symbol, BigInt`<br>
2. Object data types : Not a primitive data types and have properties which have value s like objects, array, functions...<br>

#### `Object`

1. Collection of `key : value` pairs. Each key maps to a value.

2. How to access to value? square bracket notation / dot notation. (might be better to use square bracket notation all the time just in case we don't know the name of property.)

3. `If key is assigned as variable, only able to access with []notation. If it's not, use .notation.`

3. `primitives are passed by value`<br>
`Objects are passed by reference`.
4. `this`
5. `for...in object iterations` : The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object. More specifically, it loops through each key.
